## Notes

+ Environment setup is challenging, especially on a non-Mac OS machine

I followed the official Ruby on Rails guide to build the blog app. It was nearly finished but last weekend I need to return my Macbook Pro to the company, so I set up a development environment on my home computer which runs Windows. I thought it would be easy since I already went through the guide but it took me more than 2 days just to set up the environment. I moved from Windows to a virtual Linux machine and there's still some issues. I ended up having little time to actually do the exercise though it just takes a few hours to finish the required functionalities after the evironment is ready.

+ The provided .gitignore file caused an issue when deployed on Heroku since it ignores the secret-token.rb file by default. Took me some time to realize that.

+ Overall this is an interesting but (surprisingly) challenging experience.
